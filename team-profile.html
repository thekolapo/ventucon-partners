                    environment that hasn’t been as supportive for business growth. Entrepreneurs have experienced

                    midst of great adversity.

                <span class="text-bold">Entrepreneurs in Africa have shown a lack of focus</span> (Trying to do so much at the same time), the lack of a proper business structure (no ideas on future succession) & most entrepreneurs aren’t ready to move along with times (they choose to remain in the past while the future is there for the taking).

                Mentors aren’t people you necessarily like the best at a certain time, mentors are people who pushed you the furthest to help you achieve your goals and targets; Mentors are people who push you to do better.
                <br><br>
                Mentorship is usually a two-way street, young professionals most times fail to understand that you have to deliver tremendous value to your mentor as well. The process is one of the best paths to career success, the benefits you gain from a good mentor/mentee relationship can outweigh school, natural ability and luck. The key is to have the foresight and humility to ask to be mentored and also stay patient while being mentored.

                <div class="text-highlight">Marketing is a big area of interest for me. It isn’t the only one, but it is what I have majorly focused on.</div>

                There are various stages of business growth, but for us there are five stages for business growth, which are; validation, marketing, creativity, leadership & relevance.
                <br><br>
                The validation of your business is an important phase of planned business growth, you get your business into the market and validate your business idea with those interested (get to know what people think about your business, industry etc.). Marketing is a stage that helps you get the word out about your business & offers.
                <br><br>
                Creativity helps you open your mind to new possibilities, innovations that drive company growth to the next level. Leadership shows your team’s drive to achieve its set mission, keeping team commitment levels at an all-time high in order to take any business to the next level of growth. Company relevance is a long term strategy which has to be in mind from the very start of a business (a company that doesn’t think about long-term relevance is a company that can’t last).

                There is a drive and ambition amongst entrepreneurs in Africa. But they have gone by their endeavors with the wrong attitude; most entrepreneurs in these parts lack patience and creativity.
                <br><br>
                The continent has been able to grow its entrepreneurial population, but most of these entrepreneurs haven’t been able to create major differences on the African economy. Africa has its peculiar problems, with a patient and creative attitude amongst our entrepreneurs we will provide solutions to Africa’s problems, foster innovation and produce real giants for the African economy.
                <br><br>
                <div class="text-highlight">I am firm believer in innovation, a firm believer in patience. Brainstorming with entrepreneurs helps me know them better, know their mission & goals and how they intend on getting there.</div>
                <br>
                With the right focus and policies to support truly innovative companies Africa can create long lasting companies. There needs to be a support system to encourage entrepreneurs ready to provide solutions to true African problems; the current crop of entrepreneurs are doing well but can do better with much more focus on the peculiarity of Africa and a more advanced local funding strategy.
                <br><br>
                The African population is expected to experience high growth rates in the next couple of years and with patience, innovation & the right investment strategies, the future will get better for Africa.

                I have a lot of theories on consumer funded technology companies and the future that beholds
                them in Africa. But I prefer to listen rather than talk, listening gives me a feel of where founders
                view themselves guiding these companies to.
                <br><br>
                The culture &amp; vision/mission of a founder are key to leading a business. They are essential
                features of an outstanding founder, you are able to get a good feel of a company’s future by
                listening to a founder talk on the company’s adopted culture &amp; vision/mission.
                <br><br>
                <div class="text-highlight">The investors we partner with &amp; founders we back will be
                guided with the same in one regard: there is a need to win.</div>
                <br>
                Each business is unique in its own way, especially in a unique business environment like
                Africa there is a need to deal different.
                <br><br>
                Knowledge is cumulative &amp; history provides context for the future, in business there is no
                respite; the number one rule here.
